## Getting Started 

- Run 
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Start server: 

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
- For now you can open [http://localhost:3000/api/testing6](http://localhost:3000/api/testing6) with your browser to create a file "01.json" that includes all the products from the first main category. <br/>
All products are grouped in subcategory. Here is an exempel:

## Info:

This is only the beginning of my final project.
The project will be a database with some .json files that will be use to store all the products for a start-up where I'm doing my internship.

## Status:
In progress
